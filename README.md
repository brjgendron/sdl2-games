# sdl2-games
this is a collection of games from 1972-present, rewritten in c++ and sdl2.

if you want to compile the source code for yourself, you need the SDL2 headers and libraries, along with the SDL2.dll placed in the same directory as the compiled executable. this is specific to your development environment so i recommend you read through the setup instructions on the SDL website if you don't know how
